# Roadmap

## Phase 1: GPS-First MVP

- Power system: 21700 + charger + 5V boost
- MCU + GPS + LED control
- Basic patterns and brightness limits
- Battery monitoring

## Phase 2: Motion-Based Logic

- Add IMU for movement classification
- Combine GPS speed with IMU intensity
- Refine activity profiles

## Phase 3: Heart Rate Integration

- Add heart-rate sensor
- Use HR as activity input for patterns
- Calibrate thresholds and safety limits

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

- BLE configuration and profiles
- Expanded pattern library
