# Smart LED Dog Collar

🐾 A smart, high-visibility LED collar for medium-to-large dogs.
Designed for safety, comfort, and future expansion (GPS, BLE app, advanced modes).

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a collar that is:

- 🔦 Highly visible at night with premium LED animation quality.
- 🏃 Motion- and speed-reactive for color and brightness changes.
- 🔋 Efficient with a single 21700 Li-ion cell.
- 🛡️ Safe, comfortable, and weather-resistant.
- 🛰️ Ready for GPS and BLE expansion.

## 📐 Mechanical Design Targets

- Neck circumference: 40-55 cm (medium/large dogs)
- Strap width: 20-25 mm
- LED diffuser: silicone tube over nylon strap
- Total weight target: 120-160 g
- Enclosure: compact, IP65-IP67, strain-relieved

---

## 💡 LED System

Recommended LEDs:

- APA102 / SK9822 (5V, clocked)
- Density: 144 LEDs/m
- Length: 45 cm
- Total LEDs: ~65

Why APA102/SK9822:

- Smooth animations at low brightness
- Better stability than WS2812
- High-quality color control

Note:

- Requires regulated 5V (do not power directly from battery)

---

## 🔋 Power System

Battery:

- 21700 Li-ion
- ~5000 mAh
- 18.5 Wh nominal energy

LED power budget (65 LEDs, average current per LED):

- 5 mA -> ~1.6 W -> ~10 hours
- 10 mA -> ~3.25 W -> ~5 hours
- 20 mA -> ~6.5 W -> ~2.5 hours

Design goal: 5-10 mA per LED average

## ⚡ Power Architecture

```
21700 Battery (3.0-4.2V)
   -> BMS 1S + USB-C charger
   -> 5V boost converter (>=2A continuous)
   -> APA102 LED strip
   -> 3.3V regulator -> ESP32-S3 + sensors
```

Additional features:

- Battery voltage monitoring
- Low-battery protection
- Physical switch or Hall sensor

---

## 🧠 Control System

MCU:

- ESP32-S3 (BLE-ready, LED control, sensor processing)

IMU options:

- BMI270
- ICM-42688
- (MPU6050 acceptable for prototypes)

Optional GPS:

- u-blox M10 series
- Powered only when movement is detected

---

## 🎨 Behavior Logic

Inputs:

- IMU movement intensity
- GPS speed (when enabled)

Outputs:

- Color mapping:
  - Resting -> Blue
  - Walking -> Purple
  - Running -> Red
- Brightness scales with activity
- Effects:
  - Breathing (idle)
  - Pulsing (medium)
  - Chase or strobe (high)
